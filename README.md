Analysis WeatherPy
OBSERVABLE TRENDS

1. In the multiple times that I ran this code, there were never any cities with humidity over 100%. There were however quite a few that had a humidity of 100%. In addition, humidity rarely seemed to fall to 0%.

2. Latitude has a moderate correlation to Max Temperature. In the Northern hemisphere, the r-score between the two is 0.48. While in the Southern Hemisphere the r-score between the two is even higher at 0.64

3. The correlation between latitude and windspeed was very low. In the Northern and Southern hemispheres, the correlation between the two were .01 and .02, respectively.
